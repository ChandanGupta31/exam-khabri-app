## 🚀 Overview

**Exam Khabri** is a smart utility app designed for Indian students preparing for competitive exams (SSC, UPSC, Banking, Railways). It solves the problem of manually checking multiple "Sarkari" websites every day.

Instead of wasting time refreshing pages, Exam Khabri uses an **intelligent cloud scraper** to monitor official sources and sends **instant push notifications** the moment a new Admit Card, Result, or Job Notification is released.

* **📱 Native Performance:** Built with Flutter for smooth 60fps performance on Android.
